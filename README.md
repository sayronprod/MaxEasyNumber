# MaxEasyNumber
This program solves the following problem: Write a program that returns the largest palindrome number that is the product of two five-digit prime numbers, and also returns the factors themselves. A prime number is a natural number that is only divisible by 1 and itself (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...) A palindrome is a string that reads the same in both directions (for example, ABBA)
